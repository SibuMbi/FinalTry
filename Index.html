    Started last monday on a hight note learning something new and all that jazz little did i know that a computer acan make you cry. 
    I have lost all my folders in my computer and I am not feeling sad about it as there is nothing I can do about it. 
    My mind and body is at peace and I look forward to the new week with the hope of doing better. 
    Coding at 40 is no joke but i will continue to laugh and cry while I make mistakes and lean. 
    Week two lets go!

    Wowza!
